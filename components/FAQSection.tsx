    question: "What makes Vistar different from other learning apps?",
    answer:
      "Vistar is a Learning Operating System, not a course marketplace. We don't sell courses or aim for engagement metrics. We engineer clarity. We believe real progress is measured by deep understanding, retention, and skill improvement—not by hours spent staring at a screen. We're grounded strictly in reality, not fantasy.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Vistar organize my learning?",
    answer:
      "Vistar centralizes all your learning resources, syllabi, and notes into one unified dashboard. Our AI analyzes your goals and creates a personalized learning path, telling you why each topic matters. You enter a distraction-free zone designed for deep work—no sidebars, no ads, just focused learning.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will Vistar be available?",
    answer:
      "We're currently in the Research & Validation phase, deeply understanding learner psychology. We're opening a Private Beta soon with the first 1,000 active learners. Join our waitlist to get early access and become a founding member with exclusive benefits.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the founding member benefits?",
    answer:
      "Founding members get early access before the public launch, 3 months of Premium features for free, and an exclusive founding member badge. Your feedback directly shapes the product development, making you part of building the future of learning.",
